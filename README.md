# Introduction

Eggie is a discord bot written in the Python programming language and the discord.py library.
It was made as a project to learn about discord.py, so it isn't a good bot by any means.<br>
Eggie has:

* **a Youtube integration**
* **a Simple economy system with a simple shop**
* **some funny commands**
